# clj-strava

A library that provides functions for consuming the Strava API V3.

Currently only auth and the GET methods are available.  Not all resources have been tested.
The library is currently in development and provided functions may change at any time.

## Usage

Leiningen dependency:

    [ekimber/clj-strava "0.1.0"]

Place your secret in a `.lein-env` file `{:strava-secret "your secret"}` in the project root,
or supply an environment variable `STRAVA_SECRET`.

NS require :

    (:require [clj-strava.api :as strava)

To acquire a token, obtain a code as described here: http://strava.github.io/api/v3/oauth/

Then we can swap the code for an access token:

    (strava/swap-tokens code)

Pass in the access token to the API functions.  They require a map of URL replacements where appropriate
and additional query params can be passed in an optional map.  Keywordized JSON is returned on an async channel.

Example: list activities

    (<!! (strava/activities access-token {"per_page 5"}))

Example: list athlete's KOMs

    (<!! (strava/athlete-koms access-token {:id 490421} {"per_page" 5}))
